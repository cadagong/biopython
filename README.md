**DNA ORF and Protein Translation Tool**

A small, self-directed Python project exploring how DNA sequences can be translated into candidate protein products by identifying open reading frames (ORFs).

This project was built as an exploratory exercise, not as part of coursework.

**Functionality**
	•	Load DNA sequences from text files
	•	Generate reading frames for both forward and reverse-complement strands
	•	Identify open reading frames using start and stop codons
	•	Translate codons into amino acid sequences
	•	Remove duplicate protein products
	•	Identify the longest candidate protein
	•	Save and compare protein sequences

**Approach**

The implementation explicitly walks through reading frames and codons to keep the biological logic transparent rather than optimized.

**Technologies**
	•	Python
	•	Manual sequence manipulation (no external pipelines)

**Notes**

This is an educational project intended to explore gene-to-protein translation mechanics. It is not meant to replace established bioinformatics tools or libraries.
